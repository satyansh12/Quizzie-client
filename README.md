# Welcome to Your React App ðŸš€

This app was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a setup that allows you to start building a new React project immediately without worrying about configuration.

## Quick Start

To get your project up and running, you'll need Node 14.0.0 or later on your local development machine. We recommend using the latest LTS version. If you need to manage multiple Node versions, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

### Running Your App

- **Starting the App**: Run `npm start` to launch your app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and you'll see your app running. The page automatically reloads if you make changes to the code.

- **Running Tests**: Execute `npm test` to run the test suite in interactive watch mode. It's set up to run tests related to files changed since the last commit by default.

- **Building for Production**: Use `npm run build` to compile your app into static files for production. This process optimizes your app for the best performance: the build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

### Customizing Your Setup

If you find that you need more control over the project's configuration, you can run `npm run eject`. This exposes the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly in your project, giving you full control. Note: this is a one-way operation and cannot be undone!
